## 01 - Define Discrete State Transitions Using the State ADT

We build our first state transactions as two discrete transactions, each working
on a specific portion of the state. Each of these transitions are governed by an
acceptable range and we want to be able to apply these limit within our model.

With our discrete transactions we see that is easy to reason about and keeps our
rules local to the data being worked on, without having to be considered in
other transitions or, even worse, in the eventual view layer. Patterns like this
make it easier to easily transport a given data model to any view layer.

### Requirements
This code example runs on a POSIX based system (Linux, OSX, etc) in a [nodejs][2] environment
requiring a version greater than `4.2.x` to be run. If you *have* to work in another environment,
this lesson also has a "sandbox" hosted on [Code Sandbox][3] that can be run in browser and can be found
here:

[Lesson Sandbox][4]

### Using This Example
This code example and environment is provided on its own branch. To run this locally, just clone
this repository down, check out this branch and run the following commands:

#### Setup Your Dependencies
To setup the lesson, execute this command in the project folder:

```
$ npm run setup
```

#### Run The Code
Once all dependencies have been pulled down, you can then run the example code.

This code runs in a node environment and logs to the console that the code was run in. Once
started, the environment will listen to changes to the files and re-run the code. This allows
you to have immediate feed back to the changes you made. To exit out of the code example,
just press the keystroke `Ctrl+C`.

To run the lesson, execute the following in the project folder:

```
$ npm start
```
