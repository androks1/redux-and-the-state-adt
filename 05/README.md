## 05 - Read And Transform Values From A State ADTâ€™s State

Many times we need to access and transform state, either in part or in full, to
be used when calculating other state transitions. We will look at how we can
leverage the `get` function on the State ADT to read and modify portions of our
application state, putting the result in the Resultant portion. We will create
two transactions: one to select a card from a list of cards and another to
access the hint portion of our state.

### Requirements
This code example runs on a POSIX based system (Linux, OSX, etc) in a [nodejs][2] environment
requiring a version greater than `4.2.x` to be run. If you *have* to work in another environment,
this lesson also has a "sandbox" hosted on [Code Sandbox][3] that can be run in browser and can be found
here:

[Lesson Sandbox][4]

### Using This Example
This code example and environment is provided on its own branch. To run this locally, just clone
this repository down, check out this branch and run the following commands:

#### Setup Your Dependencies
To setup the lesson, execute this command in the project folder:

```
$ npm run setup
```

#### Run The Code
Once all dependencies have been pulled down, you can then run the example code.

This code runs in a node environment and logs to the console that the code was run in. Once
started, the environment will listen to changes to the files and re-run the code. This allows
you to have immediate feed back to the changes you made. To exit out of the code example,
just press the keystroke `Ctrl+C`.

To run the lesson, execute the following in the project folder:

```
$ npm start
```
