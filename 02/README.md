## 02 - Combine State Dependent Transactions With The State ADT

When developing a Finite State Machine, it is often necessary to apply multiple
transitions in tandem. To accomplish this in most Redux work flows requires at
best, implementing multiple action handlers in separate reducers; or at worse,
the need to duplicate logic for similar action handlers, sometime across
multiple files. However when using a State ADT, we can easily combine these
independent transitions by simply `chain`-ing multiple discrete transitions into
one transaction. We demonstrate this interface by transitioning two portions of
related state with one transaction.

### Requirements
This code example runs on a POSIX based system (Linux, OSX, etc) in a [nodejs][2] environment
requiring a version greater than `4.2.x` to be run. If you *have* to work in another environment,
this lesson also has a "sandbox" hosted on [Code Sandbox][3] that can be run in browser and can be found
here:

[Lesson Sandbox][4]

### Using This Example
This code example and environment is provided on its own branch. To run this locally, just clone
this repository down, check out this branch and run the following commands:

#### Setup Your Dependencies
To setup the lesson, execute this command in the project folder:

```
$ npm run setup
```

#### Run The Code
Once all dependencies have been pulled down, you can then run the example code.

This code runs in a node environment and logs to the console that the code was run in. Once
started, the environment will listen to changes to the files and re-run the code. This allows
you to have immediate feed back to the changes you made. To exit out of the code example,
just press the keystroke `Ctrl+C`.

To run the lesson, execute the following in the project folder:

```
$ npm start
```
