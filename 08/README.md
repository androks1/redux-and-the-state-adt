## 08 - Generate Randomness Using the State ADT

While the `Math.random` function that ships with JavaScript  is super handy to
have, it can make functional programmers cringe due to its, well randomness. We
have no control over how the RNG is seeded, which removes all purity from the
function and makes it difficult to test without mocking or implementing features
like replays or time travel. We can take advantage of the nature of the State
ADT by implementing a Linear Congruential Generator and keeping track of our
seed in the state.

### Requirements
This code example runs on a POSIX based system (Linux, OSX, etc) in a [nodejs][2] environment
requiring a version greater than `4.2.x` to be run. If you *have* to work in another environment,
this lesson also has a "sandbox" hosted on [Code Sandbox][3] that can be run in browser and can be found
here:

[Lesson Sandbox][4]

### Using This Example
This code example and environment is provided on its own branch. To run this locally, just clone
this repository down, check out this branch and run the following commands:

#### Setup Your Dependencies
To setup the lesson, execute this command in the project folder:

```
$ npm run setup
```

#### Run The Code
Once all dependencies have been pulled down, you can then run the example code.

This code runs in a node environment and logs to the console that the code was run in. Once
started, the environment will listen to changes to the files and re-run the code. This allows
you to have immediate feed back to the changes you made. To exit out of the code example,
just press the keystroke `Ctrl+C`.

To run the lesson, execute the following in the project folder:

```
$ npm start
```
